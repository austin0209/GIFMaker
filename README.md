# GIFMaker
A straight-forward GIF capture program

Credits to Elliot Kroo for the GIF sequence writer.

## Usage:

Click "Select Region" to select a region. A selection is made by clicking and dragging.
Once the region is selected, click "Make GIF." The resulting gif will be saved in the active directory.

## Parameter Info:
Use these parameters to edit the smoothness and file size of your GIF, as well as to change the semantics of the program for your  convenience.
  - **Number of Frames** - The number of frames the program will capture
  - **Time Between Frames** - The amount of time in milliseconds the program waits before capturing each frame
  - **Compression Factor** - Use this to lower the file size. The width and height of the resulting GIF will be the width and height of your selection multiplied by the compression factor (higher = less compression, smaller dimensions/file size)
  - **File Name** - The file name of your resulting GIF. This is saved in the active directory (the directory that you run the program in).
  - **Countdown Time** - The amount of time in seconds the program waits before beginning the capture process
